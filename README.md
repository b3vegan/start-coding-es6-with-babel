# [Start Coding ES6 With Babel][published url]
## Instructor: [Jason Green][instructor url]

JavaScript has evolved a lot over the years. The latest version of the language, ECMASCript 6 (ES6 for short) was recently finalized and it brings a lot of improvements for developers. Of course, brower support is still spotty.

What if you don't want to wait for modern browser adoption or to update your server to node 0.12? In this course we'll discover how we can write full stack ES6 today. We'll use Babel, along with other build tools like Browserify and Gulp to transpile our ES6 into plain ES5, which is supported by the vast majority of browsers.

# Source Files Description:
